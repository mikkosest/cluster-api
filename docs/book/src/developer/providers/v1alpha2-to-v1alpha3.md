# Cluster API v1alpha2 compared to v1alpha3

## Minimum Go version

- The Go version used by Cluster API is now Go 1.13+

## In-Tree bootstrap provider

- Cluster API now ships with the Kubeadm Bootstrap provider (CABPK).
- Update import paths from `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api-bootstrap-provider-kubeadm` to `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/bootstrap/kubeadm`.

## Machine `spec.metadata` field has been removed

- The field has been unused for quite some time and didn't have any function.
- If you have been using this field to setup MachineSet or MachineDeployment, switch to MachineTemplate's metadata instead.

## Set `spec.clusterName` on Machine, MachineSet, MachineDeployments

- The field is now required on all Cluster dependant objects.
- The `cluster.x-k8s.io/cluster-name` label is created automatically by each respective controller.

## Context is now required for `external.CloneTemplate` function.

- Pass a context as the first argument to calls to `external.CloneTemplate`.

## Context is now required for `external.Get` function.

- Pass a context as the first argument to calls to `external.Get`.

## Cluster and Machine `Status.Phase` field values now start with an uppercase letter

- To be consistent with Pod phases in k/k.
- More details in https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/pull/1532/files.

## `MachineClusterLabelName` is renamed to `ClusterLabelName`

- The variable name is renamed as this label isn't applied only to machines anymore.
- This label is also applied to external objects(bootstrap provider, infrastructure provider)

## Cluster and Machine controllers now set `cluster.x-k8s.io/cluster-name` to external objects.

- In addition to the OwnerReference back to the Cluster, a label is now added as well to any external objects, for example objects such as KubeadmConfig (bootstrap provider), AWSCluster (infrastructure provider), AWSMachine (infrastructure provider), etc.

## The `util/restmapper` package has been removed

- Controller runtime has native support for a [DynamicRESTMapper](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/pull/554/files), which is used by default when creating a new Manager.

## Generated kubeconfig admin username changed from `kubernetes-admin` to `<cluster-name>-admin`

- The kubeconfig secret shipped with Cluster API now uses the cluster name as prefix to the `username` field.

## Changes to `sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api/controllers/remote`

-  The `ClusterClient` interface has been removed.
- `remote.NewClusterClient` now returns a `sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/client` Client. The signature changed from

    `func NewClusterClient(c client.Client, cluster *clusterv1.Cluster) (ClusterClient, error)`

    to

    `func NewClusterClient(c client.Client, cluster *clusterv1.Cluster, scheme runtime.Scheme) (client.Client, error)`

## A Machine is now considered a control plane if it has `cluster.x-k8s.io/control-plane` set, regardless of value

- Previously examples and tests were setting/checking for the label to be set to `true`.
- The function `util.IsControlPlaneMachine` was previously checking for any value other than empty string, while now we only check if the associated label exists.

## Machine `Status.Phase` field set to `Provisioned` if a NodeRef is set but infrastructure is not ready

 - The machine Status.Phase is set back to `Provisioned` if the infrastructure is not ready. This is only applicable if the infrastructure node status does not have any errors set.

## Metrics

- The cluster and machine controllers expose the following prometheus metrics.
  - `capi_cluster_control_plane_ready`: Cluster control plane is ready if set to 1 and not if 0.
  - `capi_cluster_infrastructure_ready`: Cluster infrastructure is ready if set to 1 and not if 0.
  - `capi_cluster_kubeconfig_ready`: Cluster kubeconfig is ready if set to 1 and not if 0.
  - `capi_cluster_failure_set`: Cluster FailureMesssage or FailureReason is set if metric is 1.
  - `capi_machine_bootstrap_ready`: Machine Boostrap is ready if set to 1 and not if 0.
  - `capi_machine_infrastructure_ready`: Machine InfrastructureRef is ready if set to 1 and not if 0.
  - `capi_machine_node_ready`: Machine NodeRef is ready if set to 1 and not if 0.

  They can be accessed by default via the `8080` metrics port on the cluster
  api controller manager.

## Cluster `Status.Phase` transition to `Provisioned` additionally needs at least one APIEndpoint to be available.

- Previously, the sole requirement to transition a Cluster's `Status.Phase` to `Provisioned` was a `true` value of `Status.InfrastructureReady`. Now, there are two requirements: a `true` value of `Status.InfrastructureReady` and at least one entry in `Status.APIEndpoints`.
- See https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/pull/1721/files.

## `Status.ErrorReason` and `Status.ErrorMessage` fields, populated to signal a fatal error has occurred, have been renamed in Cluster, Machine and MachineSet

-  `Status.ErrorReason` has been renamed to `Status.FailureReason`
-  `Status.ErrorMessage` has been renamed to `Status.FailureMessage`

## The `external.ErrorsFrom` function has been renamed to `external.FailuresFrom`

- The function has been modified to reflect the rename of `Status.ErrorReason` to `Status.FailureReason` and `Status.ErrorMessage` to `Status.FailureMessage`.

## External objects will need to rename `Status.ErrorReason` and `Status.ErrorMessage`

- As a follow up to the changes mentioned above - for the `external.FailuresFrom` function to retain its functionality, external objects
(e.g., AWSCluster, AWSMachine, etc.) will need to rename the fields as well.
-  `Status.ErrorReason` should be renamed to `Status.FailureReason`
-  `Status.ErrorMessage` should be renamed to `Status.FailureMessage`

## The field `Cluster.Status.APIEndpoints` is removed in favor of `Cluster.Spec.ControlPlaneEndpoint`

- The slice in Cluster.Status has been removed and replaced by a single APIEndpoint field under Spec.
- Infrastructure providers MUST expose a ControlPlaneEndpoint field in their cluster infrastructure resource at `Spec.ControlPlaneEndpoint`. They may optionally remove the `Status.APIEndpoints` field (Cluster API no longer uses it).

## Data generated from a bootstrap provider is now stored in a secret.

- The Cluster API Machine Controller no longer reconciles the bootstrap provider `status.bootstrapData` field, but instead looks at `status.dataSecretName`.
- The `Machine.Spec.Bootstrap.Data` field is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
- Bootstrap providers must create a Secret in the bootstrap resource's namespace and store the name in the bootstrap resource's `status.dataSecretName` field.
    - On reconciliation, we suggest to migrate from the deprecated field to a secret reference.
- Infrastructure providers must look for the bootstrap data secret name in `Machine.Spec.Bootstrap.DataSecretName` and fallback to `Machine.Spec.Bootstrap.Data`.

## The `cloudinit` module under the Kubeadm bootstrap provider has been made private

The `cloudinit` module has been moved to an `internal` directory as it is not designed to be a public interface consumed
outside of the existing module.

## Interface for Bootstrap Provider Consumers

- Consumers of bootstrap configuration, Machine and eventually MachinePool, must adhere to a
  contract that defines a set of required fields used for coordination with the kubeadm bootstrap
  provider.
  - `apiVersion` to check for supported version/kind.
  - `kind` to check for supported version/kind.
  - `metadata.labels["cluster.x-k8s.io/control-plane"]` only present in the case of a control plane
    `Machine`.
  - `spec.clusterName` to retrieve the owning Cluster status.
  - `spec.bootstrap.dataSecretName` to know where to put bootstrap data with sensitive information.
  - `status.infrastuctureReady` to understand the state of the configuration consumer so the
    bootstrap provider can take appropriate action (e.g. renew bootstrap token).

## Support the `cluster.x-k8s.io/paused` annotation and `Cluster.Spec.Paused` field.

- A new annotation `cluster.x-k8s.io/paused` provides the ability to pause reconciliation on specific objects.
- A new field `Cluster.Spec.Paused` provides the ability to pause reconciliation on a Cluster and all associated objects.
- A helper function `util.IsPaused` can be used on any Kubernetes object associated with a Cluster.
